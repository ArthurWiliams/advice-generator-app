## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Build Tool
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset

### Continued development

I think I've done enough projects with Vanilla Typescript. Going forward I'm going to focus on building projects using JS Frameworks like Vue or Solid unless the project doesn't require much if any JS at all.
